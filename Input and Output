/*In this challenge, we practice reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout./*

/*TASK:
Read 3 numbers from stdin and print their sum to stdout.*/

/*INPUT FORMAT:
One line that contains 3 space-separated integers: a, b, and c.*/

/*OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the sum of the three numbers on a single line.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  /*declare the following variable:*/
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;

  /* we want to use cin to read the input, 
     We can do this with the following code:*/
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

  /* If we want to print these values to stdout, separated by a space, we write the following code:*/
    cout << a + b + c << endl;
    return 0;
}

/*EXPLANATION:
The sum of the three numbers is 1+2+7=10.*/
